# Q4. Write a while loop to print the following series.
# 105,98,91,84,....7
i = 105
while i >= 1:
    print(i)
    i = i - 7

# ex1 : print 1 to 100 using while loop

i = 1
# while i < 101:
#     print(i)
#     i = i + 1

# ex1 : print 100 to 1 using while loop
i = 105
while i >=1:
    print(i)
    i = i - 7
