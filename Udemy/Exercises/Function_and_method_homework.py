''' Write a function that computes the volume of a sphere given its radius.
The volume of a sphere is given as
4/3œÄùëü3

in a given range (inclusive of high and low)

'''Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates 
the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 4
No. of Lower case Characters : 33
HINT: Two string methods that might prove useful: .isupper() and .islower()

If you feel ambitious, explore the Collections module to solve this problem!
